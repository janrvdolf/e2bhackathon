    "best_network": 0,
    "explanation": "All three neural networks have identical architectures and performance metrics, achieving the same test accuracy of 0.9912 and test loss of 0.0335. However, network 0 is marginally faster in training, with slightly lower epoch times on average. This minor efficiency advantage makes it the best choice among the three identical networks."
