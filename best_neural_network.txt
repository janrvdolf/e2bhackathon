    "best_network": 0,
    "explanation": "Neural network 0 is the best among the three given architectures. It achieves the highest test accuracy of 0.9912, which is slightly better than network 2 (also 0.9912) and significantly better than network 1 (0.9765). Additionally, network 0 shows consistent improvement in both training and validation accuracy throughout the epochs, with less overfitting compared to network 1. The convolutional layers in networks 0 and 2 are better suited for image classification tasks like MNIST, which explains their superior performance over the fully connected network 1."
